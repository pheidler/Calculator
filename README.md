# Calculator
Calculator created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Thoughts:

This project was surprisingly fun and intuitive for me. It was pretty straightforward coming up with the GUI for the calculator through HTML/CSS, so the biggest leap for me was interacting with the various elements through JavaScript. This is my first foray into JavaScript, and I can't help but feel like I'm not taking full advantage of it. First order functions and callback functions seem cool, but I wasn't totally sure how to use them in this project. The end product is functional, but it's certainly messy. Still a lot of things I don't totally understand. CSS is also a pain in the ass. Planning on doing a few more projects with vanilla HTML/CSS before I go on to learn a framework, but it is tempting to try and move on because it's damn frustrating. All in all, I'm pretty happy with how things turned out, and this definitely marks some progress for me.
